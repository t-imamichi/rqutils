"""Tests for :mod:`rqutils.ground_locg`.

Organized by defect. Most tests correspond to a numbered item in ``docs/locg.md``, the audit of the
previous implementation of this module; each such test names its item and the measured old failure.
That audit's closing warning shapes the design here:

    Aggregate random sampling does not exercise data-dependent branches evenly. [...] Both of my
    safety nets missed a sign error that a two-line targeted test caught at 4000/4000 failures.

So targeted per-branch tests are the backbone and randomized sweeps are a supplement.
